# Linked List

## What is a linked list?

- A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
- Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null
- A node gives reference to next node. 


## Comparing Array and Linked List

### Lists

- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed Arrays

### Arrays

- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
