# Linked List

## What is a linked list?

- A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
- Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null
- A node gives reference to next node. 


## Comparing Array and Linked List

!["This is array vs linked list image"](../../assets/Images/array_vs_linked.PNG)

### Lists

- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed Arrays

### Arrays

- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

## Comparing Single and Doubly Linked List

-   Doubly Linked Lists are almost identical to Singly Linked Lists except there is an additional pointer to previous nodes
-   Better than Singly Linked Lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time!
-   However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer
-   Doubly linked lists are used to implement other data structures and certain types of caches
