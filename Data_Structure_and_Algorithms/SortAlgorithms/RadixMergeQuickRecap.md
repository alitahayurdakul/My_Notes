# Radix Merge Quick Recap
- Merge sort and quick sort are standard efficient sorting algorithms
- Quick sort can be slow in the worst case, but is comparable to merge sort on average
- Merge sort takes up more memory because it creates a new array (in-place merge sorts exist, but they are really complex!)
- Radix sort is a fast sorting algorithm for numbers
- Radix sort exploits place value to sort numbers in linear time (for a fixed number of digits)
